2013-07-27 RELEASE 0.1.1
========================

This release fixes a bug with TOC generation on python 2, creates a
correct long_description for pypi and adds some uncommitted CSS
improvements. Running the finished site under WSGI is now tested and
works ok-ish (although search is still unimplemented).

2013-07-26 RELEASE 0.1.0
========================

This is just a test release to test out pypi uploading as well as git
branching and tagging. Neverthless, this code is approaching feature
completeness, except that running a finished site under WSGI hasn't
been tested. Generating a static HTML site should work OK-ish.
