Ferenda is a python library and framework to scrape and convert
unstructured content into semantically-marked-up, Linked Data-enabled
content. It is focused on documents, not individual pieces of data,
but is useful for any kind of information that can be described in
terms of resources (documents, people, places, events, etc...). It
uses RDF for all metadata.

Quick start
-----------

This example uses ferenda's project framework to download the 50
latest RFCs and W3C standards, parse documents into structured,
RDF-enabled XHTML documents, loads all RDF metadata into a triplestore
and generates a web site of static HTML5 files that are usable
offline::

    pip install --extra-index-url https://testpypi.python.org/pypi ferenda
    ferenda-setup myproject
    cd myproject
    ./ferenda-build.py ferenda.sources.tech.RFC enable
    ./ferenda-build.py ferenda.sources.tech.W3Standards enable
    ./ferenda-build.py all all --downloadmax=50 --staticsite --fulltextindex=False
    open data/index.html

The same functionality can also be accessed through a python API, if
you want to use ferenda as part of a larger system. It's also possible
to just use the parts of ferenda that you need (eg. only the
downloading and parsing features).
