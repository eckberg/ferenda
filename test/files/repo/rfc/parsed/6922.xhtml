      <p>The Structured Query Language (SQL) has been in use for over 30 years with various types of database technologies. However, there is no current media type registered for SQL. Therefore, this document seeks to formally register the application/sql media type to be used for SQL with IANA.</p>

    <div content="Media Type Registration Application" about="http://localhost:8000/res/rfc/6922#S3" property="dct:title" class="section" typeof="bibo:DocumentPart">
      <span content="3" property="bibo:chapter" xml:lang=""/>
      <p>This section provides the media type registration application for this media type (see <a href="#bib-RFC6838">[RFC6838]</a>, Section 5.6)</p>
      <p>Type name: application</p>
      <p>Subtype name: sql</p>
      <p>Required parameters: N/A</p>
      <p>Optional parameters:</p>
      <p>      "charset" -- indicates the character set to be used.  When not
      specified, a default value MUST NOT be assumed without inspection
      of the content.</p>
      <p>      Implementors should be aware that SQL may carry character set
      information in-band.  In such cases, the "charset" parameter MUST
      NOT be used in order to avoid conflict.  In cases where no
      character set information is supplied in-band, and the character</p>
      <p>      set is known, implementors SHOULD use the "charset" parameter.  If
      no in-band or out-of-band character set information is available,
      implementors MUST NOT specify the "charset" parameter.</p>
      <p>Encoding considerations:</p>
      <p>      If the "charset" parameter is used, the corresponding 7-bit,
      8-bit, or binary encoding may be used.  If the "charset" parameter
      is not used, binary encoding may be required.</p>
      <p>Security considerations:</p>
      <p>      Being that SQL is a full-fledged programming language and may
      include embedded source code for other programming languages,
      there is a risk of it being used to transfer malware, viruses, and
      other malicious payloads.  Implementors and users are encouraged
      only to exchange SQL files among trusted parties and utilize all
      available security measures, such as restricted access, virus
      scanners, etc., to minimize risk.</p>
      <p>      Implementors should be aware that guessing character sets,
      encodings, and possible conflicts between in-band and out-of-band
      character set information may lead to the similar security issues
      as described above.</p>
      <p>      Implementors should also be aware that SQL does not provide or
      guarantee any sort of confidentiality and integrity checking, and
      SQL files can expose account information or private information
      about database structure and contents.  It is therefore important
      for applications to provide confidentiality and protection against
      modification by malicious third parties while in transit.</p>
      <p>Interoperability considerations:</p>
      <p>      While a single standard exists ([ISO.9075.2011]), vendor
      implementations of the standard vary significantly.  Implementors
      and users should make sure that the exchanged SQL files match to
      the specific database/tool and version that they are using.</p>
      <p>Published specification:</p>
      <p>      The most recent specification of SQL is available in
      [ISO.9075.2011].</p>
      <p>Applications that use this media type:</p>
      <p>      Databases and related tools</p>
      <p>Fragment identifier considerations: N/A</p>
      <p>Additional information:</p>
      <p>      Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A</p>
      <p>      Magic number(s): N/A</p>
      <p>      File extension(s): sql</p>
