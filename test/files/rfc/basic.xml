        <str>The Feature-Caps header field is used by SIP entities to convey support of features and capabilities, by setting feature-capability indicators. A feature-capability indicator conveyed in a Feature-Caps header field indicates that a SIP entity in the SIP message signaling path supports the associated feature and capability.</str>
