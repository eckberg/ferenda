URIs as identifiers
-------------------

And how URIs are used throughout.

The basic mechanism for storing data with metadata.

Vocabularies
------------

Ferenda supports common vocabularies and/or your own.


Serving useful data for URIs
----------------------------

Aka "the URI is the API"


Linked Data API
